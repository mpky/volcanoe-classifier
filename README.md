#### Volcanoes on Venus Image Classifier

I trained various machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, LR, CNN) to recognize if a given image of the planet Venus has a volcano in it or not and compared model performance.

Several baseline models such as XGBoost and Logistic Regression were able to perform nearly as well as the best CNN.
